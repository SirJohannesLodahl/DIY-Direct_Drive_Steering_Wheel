Building My Own Force Feedback Steering Wheel with FFbeast – A DIY Journey

This is a full deep dive into my DIY force feedback steering wheel project, powered by the open-source firmware FFbeast. But this isn’t just about mounting a motor and calling it a day — I’m building everything from the ground up:

the mechanical structure of the wheel,

the electronics and motor control setup,

the configuration and tuning of FFbeast firmware,

and even the integration of custom wireless microcontrollers to handle buttons, shifters, and other inputs inside the wheel rim.

My goal is to create a clean, responsive, and modular setup that feels like a professional direct-drive system – but built entirely by myself, with full control over both hardware and software. From CAD modeling and 3D printing, to programming low-power wireless communication protocols on the ESP32 – I’m documenting every step.

Whether it’s force feedback tuning or battery management inside the wheel, this is a full-stack engineering adventure into sim racing hardware. 

Feel free to reach out!

This project is meant to be as open and educational as possible. If you’re working on a similar setup, struggling with FFbeast configuration, or trying to build your own wireless button system – feel free to contact me! I’m happy to share what I’ve learned and would love to hear about your builds as well.
