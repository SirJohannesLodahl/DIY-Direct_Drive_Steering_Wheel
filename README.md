# DIY-Direct_Drive_Steering_Wheel
Building My Own Force Feedback Steering Wheel with FFbeast ‚Äì A DIY Journey

This is a full deep dive into my DIY force feedback steering wheel project, powered by the open-source firmware FFbeast. 

My goal is to create a clean, responsive, fully 3d printable and modular setup that feels like a professional direct-drive system ‚Äì but built entirely by myself, with full control over both hardware and software. From CAD modeling and 3D printing, to programming low-power wireless communication protocols on the ESP32 ‚Äì I‚Äôm documenting every step.



This project is meant to be as open and educational as possible. If you‚Äôre working on a similar setup, struggling with FFbeast configuration, or trying to build your own wireless button system ‚Äì feel free to contact me! I‚Äôm happy to share what I‚Äôve learned and would love to hear about your builds as well.

## üß∞ Step-by-Step Guide

A complete walkthrough from hardware to firmware.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Prepare Your Workspace

* Clear a safe, static-free workbench
* Gather tools (screwdrivers, soldering iron, multimeter, etc.)
* Install required software (see [Tools](#tools))

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Assemble the Hardware

* Mount the motor and baseplate
* Connect the motor to the driver board
* Install the power supply and fuse
* Wire encoder and signal cables
* Optional: Add cooling or fan control

---

### üö∞ 3. Build the Wheel Rim

* 3D print or assemble the wheel structure
* Mount buttons and shifters
* Install ESP32 and battery
* Wire buttons to GPIO pins
* Test charging setup (USB or wireless)

---

### üîå 4. Flash the Firmware

#### FFbeast (Motor Controller)

* Download the latest FFbeast release
* Flash firmware to your controller (e.g. STM32, G431, ODrive...)
* Configure basic parameters (via USB or serial)

#### ESP32 (Wireless Rim)

* Clone this repo
* Open `/rim-fw` in PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
* Flash to your ESP32
* Test Bluetooth connection to PC

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è 5. Configuration & Tuning

* Connect to FFbeast UI (via USB)
* Set motor type, encoder, and FFB strength
* Assign button mappings (if applicable)
* Fine-tune PID and filtering
* Save and back up config

---

### üéÆ 6. Testing & Integration

* Connect system via USB to your PC
* Open a sim racing game (e.g. Assetto Corsa)
* Check for force feedback, button input, etc.
* Adjust firmware or game settings as needed
* Celebrate your first lap!

---

### üß™ 7. Troubleshooting

If things don't work:

* Re-check all power and ground connections
* Look at serial logs from FFbeast / ESP32
* Test each subsystem (motor, rim, buttons) separately
* Open an [Issue](https://github.com/...) or check the [Discussion](#)
